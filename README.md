# Emotion Detection from Text using NLP & Transformer Models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Emotion Detection system that classifies textual input into multiple emotional categories such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise, and love using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Transformer-based deep learning models.

The system is integrated with a Telegram Bot to provide real-time emotion detection from user messages.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-class emotion classification
- Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)
- Real-time Telegram Bot integration
- Confidence score for predicted emotion
- Logging for monitoring and debugging

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch
- python-telegram-bot
- NLP Techniques (Tokenization, Text Classification)

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a labeled Emotion Detection dataset commonly available on Kaggle for training and evaluation.
